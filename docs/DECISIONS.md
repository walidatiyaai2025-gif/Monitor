# Decisions

## ADR-001 — Visual product before deep collectors

M0 delivers a working UI preview before broad SQL monitoring capability. This allows product direction to be validated early.

## ADR-002 — Snapshot-first architecture

Monitoring values will be centrally collected into reusable snapshots. UI widgets do not independently query SQL Servers.

## ADR-003 — One central live area

The SQL Command Center owns the main live visual language. Detailed pages consume the latest snapshot and show snapshot age.

## ADR-004 — Motion is not collection

Heartbeat, clocks and transitions are client-side presentation. They must never increase SQL collection frequency.

## ADR-005 — Development authentication

M0 uses a single Administrator and ASP.NET Core cookie auth. The agreed development password is represented only by a PBKDF2-SHA256 hash/salt in source control.

## ADR-006 — AI remains advisory

Future AI integration will receive normalized evidence and propose explanations/remediation/query suggestions. It will not autonomously execute production SQL.

## ADR-007 — Registration metadata is separate from connection secrets

Server registrations may contain endpoint and authentication-mode metadata, but never passwords or full connection strings. Secret values are resolved through a backend-only boundary from external secret configuration. Registration JSON omits even the opaque secret reference, and missing secrets fail closed.
