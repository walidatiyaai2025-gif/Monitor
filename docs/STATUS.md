## P0.5 repository preparation — COMPLETE · EXTERNAL IIS PENDING

- Acceptance tooling PR #127 merged as `9bdd96940454f2586c0e81ff0c25a524d7f1281c`.
- Production-candidate PR #126 merged as `d512ee156f07db566898a817f3c76dd3f46c1091`.
- Candidate/docs reconciliation PR #128 merged as `564f7655a1001da98addd793a000a15d069a243a`.
- Safe IIS SingleNode deployment automation merged as `7cb47945b47aab6558f7132dcfa818b9f02d2b20`.
- BATCH-500 added fail-closed production acceptance/recovery safety; BATCH-600 added live operator readiness/evidence orchestration without changing the external-acceptance boundary.
- Issue #141 / PR #142 COMPLETE: machine-verifiable exact 15-gate external acceptance pack + fail-closed closure validator, merged `5ee5431cce26e875d80a4cfb623553f762c8a161`.
- Issue #144 / PR #145 COMPLETE: explicit one-gate recorder `Set-ProductionAcceptanceGate.ps1`, merged `8a548c984c62b904a184e54415ea7bf491dc78fb`.
- Issue #147 / PR #148 COMPLETE: `Complete-ProductionAcceptance.ps1` removes manual final `acceptedBy` / `acceptedAtUtc` edits and adds explicit final acknowledgement, prospective 15/15 validation, concurrent-pack mutation detection, atomic final metadata commit, authoritative revalidation/closure summary and fail-closed rollback. PR #148 squash-merged as `e15a9654fbe744e426c95d5965a5faba60868e14`.
- Issue #150 / PR #151 COMPLETE: `New-ProductionAcceptanceSession.ps1` creates one fresh immutable candidate-bound workspace with verified candidate/checksum bytes, a SHA-locked non-secret manifest, the canonical fail-closed 15-gate pack at 0/15 and deterministic operator next steps. PR #151 squash-merged as `9a76abe61422502c4889b04ce8b6a59f18ac04f4`.
- Issue #154 / PR #155 COMPLETE: direct RC.53 artifact audit exposed release-package drift and ambiguous manifest evidence naming. PR #155 squash-merged as `8d8ae2c5f35e8a1d774c5a9480f582e432e5dc03`; tagged/manual releases now delegate to the same verified Windows production-candidate workflow, candidate versions are validated, and release manifest schema 2 records fixed P0.4 run IDs as `prerequisiteEvidence.p04` rather than candidate-specific acceptance evidence.

### Final selected PR #155 / RC.61 repository evidence

- source head `e28158da67b36dfc5dbf8f4c38b5c43d99c7c728`;
- exact tested merge ref `158148d8bfd05f724014541bc7a0b1eab5dae1b5`;
- merged main commit `8d8ae2c5f35e8a1d774c5a9480f582e432e5dc03`;
- normal CI `31667721350`: **Green**, Release **0 warnings / 0 errors**, **770/770 tests passed**;
- Real SQL `31667721353`: **Green**, SQL Server 2022 + Agent + non-sysadmin least privilege, **8/8**;
- Windows production-candidate `31667721306`: **Green end-to-end**, Release **0 warnings / 0 errors**, **770/770 tests passed**;
- explicit candidate-version validation, PowerShell parser, immutable session initializer, one-gate recorder and finalizer runtime all Green;
- synthetic exact 15 gates were recorded through the recorder, followed by prospective and authoritative 15/15 validation, final metadata commit and independent validator recheck;
- HTTPS health + Administrator authentication passed before and after process restart;
- package validation proved `SingleNode=True`, `DevelopmentCredentialPublished=False`, `PersistedStatePublished=False`, `PackageValidated=True`;
- selected cutover candidate `Monitor-0.1.0-rc.61-win-x64.zip`;
- product SHA-256 `d0a71f8a5611621ee388a1109dedc76e1a6e70357404cb62c9c7aa188f49c3d5`;
- Actions artifact ID `9168574442`;
- outer Actions artifact digest `sha256:1c499b9eb0bfc4245716c14718381b71352df8392aafe430cc415b375b93f382`.

Independent artifact inspection after CI re-hashed the RC.61 product ZIP to the same SHA-256, matched the companion checksum, confirmed 95 package files and all 19 expected `_operations` entries, and verified `_operations/release-manifest.json` schema 2 with `prerequisiteEvidence.p04`, `candidateVerification.sourceOfTruth=#116`, `embeddedWorkflowRunIds=false`, and no legacy `realSqlAcceptance` field.

RC.61 supersedes RC.53 unless a later equivalently verified candidate is explicitly selected on #116.

**No external IIS gate is implied by repository CI. #116 and #111 remain OPEN until the real trusted-certificate Windows/IIS SingleNode target produces a valid real 15/15 evidence pack, explicit approved operator finalization and reviewed closure summary.**

## BATCH-200 baseline reconciliation — ACTIVE IN PR #156

A current-main audit found a real historical mismatch: the historical BATCH-200 completion marker existed while B200-051..060 and B200-071..090 implementation files were absent from `main` and `docs/BATCH_200.md` still marked those task ranges as PLANNED.

PR #156 is a selective current-main reconciliation, not a merge of stale PR #104. It restores retention governance, enterprise security hardening and bounded scale primitives plus mapped B200-051..090 regression tests and an audit-pagination regression. The branch explicitly preserves `IServerTargetLifecycleService`, later BATCH-300/P0 behavior and merged RC.61 release-parity work. Earlier implementation CI `31667610170` was Green; exact-head final CI is required before merge.

This baseline correction is historical reconciliation rather than new task accounting. It does not change #116, does not claim production acceptance and does not automatically replace RC.61.

## BATCH-600 — Live Operator Readiness & Evidence Orchestration

**Issue:** #134 — CLOSED / COMPLETED  
**PR:** #139 — squash-merged  
**Merge commit:** `08513eeae75d70b8a499124f6ed19628c8a27f19`  
**Task range:** B600-001..100  
**State:** **100/100 COMPLETE**.

B600 delivered deterministic fail-closed repository orchestration for evidence freshness, gate dependency graph, operator action queue, change-window safety, candidate promotion, evidence completeness, secret-safe summaries, fleet readiness aggregation, acceptance snapshot versioning/ETag and a versioned release contract.

## Stable guardrails

- Monitoring/navigation GETs do not initiate monitored-SQL collection.
- No browser connects directly to monitored SQL.
- No autonomous remediation or AI SQL execution.
- Credentials/full connection strings/raw provider errors/arbitrary SQL text stay outside UI, audit, exports, diagnostics and production evidence.
- Suppression does not rewrite incident evidence.
- Maintenance affects scheduled collection only; manual refresh remains explicit and audited.
- Mutations remain POST + antiforgery + named authorization policy.
- MultiNode remains fail-closed and deferred until after stable SingleNode production acceptance.
- Concurrent team work must be preserved; external P0.5 acceptance cannot be inferred from CI.

**Overall:** 🟢 verified foundation · 🟢 P0.1–P0.4 COMPLETE · 🟢 P0.5 repository cutover/evidence/session/finalization/release workflow COMPLETE · 🟡 external IIS/HTTPS 15-gate acceptance pending · 🟡 BATCH-200 current-main reconciliation PR #156 active · 🔴 production acceptance not yet granted
