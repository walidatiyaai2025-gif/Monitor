### Final PR #151 / RC.53 repository evidence

- source head `b2b004e1a811dfe0eb4197be893aac5116c58cc2`;
- exact tested merge ref `68cd8f25819f82a9cb7205ed81523f4beb55d5e5`;
- merged main commit `9a76abe61422502c4889b04ce8b6a59f18ac04f4`;
- normal CI `31540968009`: **Green**, Release **0 warnings / 0 errors**, **769/769 tests passed**;
- Real SQL `31540967997`: **Green**, SQL Server 2022 + Agent + non-sysadmin least privilege, **8/8**;
- Windows production-candidate `31540968010`: **Green end-to-end**, Release **0 warnings / 0 errors**, **769/769 tests passed**;
- PowerShell parser includes session initializer, recorder, finalizer and validator;
- immutable session runtime created a candidate-bound workspace at **0/15**;
- negative session cases rejected reused root, tampered checksum, non-ZIP artifact, secret-like metadata, relative path and traversal-bearing absolute path;
- recorder/finalizer synthetic 15/15 flow remained Green;
- HTTPS health + Administrator authentication passed before and after process restart;
- package validation proved `SingleNode=True`, `DevelopmentCredentialPublished=False`, `PersistedStatePublished=False`, `PackageValidated=True`;
- selected cutover candidate `Monitor-0.1.0-rc.53-win-x64.zip`;
- product SHA-256 `466e056a85b1389b817fcbd9c622aeacd448c77596e2d5b3a6e450a7f0afca00`;
- Actions artifact ID `9120696113`.

RC.53 supersedes RC.43 unless a later equivalently verified candidate is explicitly selected on #116. The packaged `_operations` workflow now starts with a fresh SHA-locked candidate session at 0/15 and then provides IIS preflight/deploy/acceptance/smoke tooling, one-gate recording, explicit finalization, exact closure validation and rollback runbooks.

**No external IIS gate is implied by repository CI. #116 and #111 remain OPEN until the real trusted-certificate Windows/IIS SingleNode target produces a valid real 15/15 evidence pack from one immutable session, explicit approved operator finalization and reviewed closure summary.**

## Stable guardrails

- Monitoring/navigation GETs do not initiate monitored-SQL collection.
- No browser connects directly to monitored SQL.
- No autonomous remediation or AI SQL execution.
- Credentials/full connection strings/raw provider errors/arbitrary SQL text stay outside UI, audit, exports, diagnostics and production evidence.
- Suppression does not rewrite incident evidence.
- Maintenance affects scheduled collection only; manual refresh remains explicit and audited.
- Mutations remain POST + antiforgery + named authorization policy.
- MultiNode remains fail-closed and deferred until after stable SingleNode production acceptance.
- Concurrent team work must be preserved; external P0.5 acceptance cannot be inferred from CI.

**Overall:** 🟢 verified foundation · 🟢 P0.1–P0.4 COMPLETE · 🟢 P0.5 repository cutover/evidence/finalization/session workflow COMPLETE · 🟡 external IIS/HTTPS 15-gate acceptance pending · 🔴 production acceptance not yet granted
